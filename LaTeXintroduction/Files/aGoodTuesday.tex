\begin{document}

The lab suggested that I should give a short introduction about \LaTeX. 
I don't know what I should present, so I have decided to introduce:

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Equation}

You can type \begin{verbatim}\alpha \end{verbatim} to obtain $\alpha$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Table/Picture}

There is a table here.

\begin{tabular}{|p{3cm}|p{6cm}|}
\hline
A1 & A2\\
\hline
Ha & \includegraphics[width = 2cm, height = 2cm]{SmileFace} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Citation}

Here, I use a paper of \cite{chang2015core}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Thesis}

Here, I suggest that people should use the format of Otago University.
